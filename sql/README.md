# Create a database based on a diagram

## Learning objectives
- Diagram a data model clearly and explain what it's doing.

### Estimated time: 3h

## Description
You will get a database diagram, interpret it, and implement the SQL needed to build that database.

*IMPORTANT NOTE: Read **all** requirements before you start building your project.*

### General requirements

- Make sure that you used correct [Gitflow](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-transversal-skills/blob/main/git-github/articles/gitflow.md).
- Make sure that you documented your work [in a professional way](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-transversal-skills/blob/main/documentation/articles/professional_repo_rules.md).

### Project requirements
- Take a look at the following database diagram for a clinic:
     -   <img src="./images/clinic_diagram.png" alt="Clinic diagram" width="1000px" />
- Create a new repo for this project.
- Create a file named `schema_based_on_diagram.sql` where you implement the database from the diagram.
- Join tables from many-to-many relationships might not appear in the diagram, but you still need them.
- Remember to add the FK indexes.
